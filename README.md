## Leaflet.Sleep

> When scrolling down a page, if you cursor hits a leaflet map, the scroll is
> stopped in it's tracks and the map starts zooming. This is annoying!
>
> `L.Sleep` removes the **dilemma** between
>
>   * disabling scrollZoom for the pages sake
>   * enabling scrollZoom for the map's sake
>
> It's an interaction-manager for your map:
> with user-interest it wakes the map and
> when ignored the map won't interfere.

### [demo](https://cliffcloud.github.io/Leaflet.Sleep)

### Use

Just include `Leaflet.Sleep.js` right after leaflet!

#### Config

These are the new options available for `L.map` and their defaults.

    {
        // false if you want an unruly map
        sleep: true,

        // time(ms) until map sleeps on mouseout
        sleepTime: 750,

        // time(ms) until map wakes on mouseover
        wakeTime: 750,

        // defines whether the user is prompted on how to wake map
        sleepNote: true,

        // should hovering wake the map?
        hoverToWake: true

        // specify a custom message to notify users how to wake
        wakeMessage: ('Click ' + (hoverToWake?' or Hover ' : '') + 'to Wake')
    }
